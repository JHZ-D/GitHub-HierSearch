You can use it to automate GUI based applications as well as REST, RPC, SOAP and other API, and protocol based testing. Due to it's text based nature and cli tools RF is a perfect match for **agile** and DevOps, and DevSecOps driven projects striving to succeed in **continuous testing**. It integrates very well with open source and commercial CI/CD solutions like Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, and Azure Pipelines - just to name a few. It is also developer friendly and can easily be versioned with Git, and used with Docker and other container and virtualisation technologies to support building and maintaining of scalable (test) environments following the `configuration as code` or `infrastructure as code` approach. RF can be used in projects of any technology stack, and runs on any infrastructure (Windows, Mac, Linux, cloud) - it is stack and infrastructure agnostic."
