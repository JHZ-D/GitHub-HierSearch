      "Catch problematic migrations at development/test time! Heavily inspired by these similar projects:\n",
      "https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations\n",
      "https://github.com/foobarfighter/safe-migrations\n",
      "Simply add this gem to the project Gemfile.\n",
      "This gem will automatically raise exceptions when potential database locking migrations are detected.\n",
      "It checks for common things like:\n",
      "Adding a column with a default\n",
      "Adding a non-concurrent index\n",
      "Mixing data changes with index or schema migrations\n",
      "Performing data or schema migrations with the DDL transaction disabled\n",
      "Using each instead of find_each to loop thru ActiveRecord objects\n",
      "These exceptions display clear instructions of how to perform the same operation the \"zero downtime way\".\n",
      "This can take a long time with significant database size or traffic and lock your table!\n",
      "First let’s add the column without a default. When we add a column with a default it has to lock the table while it performs an UPDATE for ALL rows to set this new default.\n",
      "Then we’ll set the new column default in a separate migration. Note that this does not update any existing data! This only sets the default for newly inserted rows going forward.\n",
      "Finally we’ll backport the default value for existing data in batches. This should be done in its own migration as well. Updating in batches allows us to lock 1000 rows at a time (or whatever batch size we prefer).\n",
      "This action can lock your database table while indexing existing data!\n",
      "Instead, let's add the index concurrently in its own migration with the DDL transaction disabled.\n",
      "This allows PostgreSQL to build the index without locking in a way that prevent concurrent inserts, updates, or deletes on the table. Standard indexes lock out writes (but not reads) on the table.\n",
      "Performing migrations that change the schema, update data, or add indexes within one big transaction is unsafe!\n",
      "Instead, let's split apart these types of migrations into separate files.\n",
      "Introduce schema changes with methods like create_table or add_column in one file. These should be run within a DDL transaction so that they can be rolled back if there are any issues.\n",
      "Update data with methods like update_all or save in another file. Data migrations tend to be much more error prone than changing the schema or adding indexes.\n",
      "Add indexes concurrently within their own file as well. Indexes should be created without the DDL transaction enabled to avoid table locking.\n",
      "The DDL transaction should only be disabled for migrations that add indexes. All other types of migrations should keep the DDL transaction enabled so that changes can be rolled back if any unexpected errors occur.\n",
      "Any other data or schema changes must live in their own migration files with the DDL transaction enabled just in case they make changes that need to be rolled back.\n",
      "This might accidentally load tens or hundreds of thousands of records into memory all at the same time!\n",
      "Let's use the find_each method to fetch records in batches instead.\n",
      "Changing a column type\n",
      "Removing a column\n",
      "Renaming a column\n",
      "Renaming a table\n",
      "We can disable any of these \"zero downtime migration\" enforcements by wrapping them in a safety_assured block.\n",
      "We can also mark an entire migration as safe by using the safety_assured helper method.\n",
      "Enforcements can be globally disabled by setting ENV[\"SAFETY_ASSURED\"] when running migrations.\n",
      "These enforcements are automatically disabled by default for the following scenarios:\n",
      "The database schema is being loaded with rake db:schema:load instead of db:migrate\n",
      "The current migration is a reverse (down) migration\n",
      "The current migration is named RollupMigrations\n",
      "Fork the project.\n",
